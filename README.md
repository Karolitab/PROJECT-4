# PROJECT-4
 This is my 4th project at my techdegree javascript course at treehouse
OOP Game Show App:

This program uses JavaScript and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) to create the "Phrase Hunter" 
word guessing game by selecting a random,
 hidden phrase, which a player tries to guess, by clicking letters on an onscreen keyboard.
/** The goal is to guess all the letters without losing all the lives(which are 5)
/** If the user choses a wrong letter, 1 heart will be discounted
/** If the user choses a correct letter, the letter will be displayed in the screen
/** If the user guesses all correct letters, the winning screen will appear, if not, losing screen will appear and the phrase will be revealed
(I added that the user sees the phrase after)



EXTRA CREDIT
/** ADDED functionality to the keyboard
/**Changes the color of .chosen letter by the user to lighter blue
/** Changes the color of .wrong letter to a red tone
/** Change the color of the header(Phrase hunter and Phrase hunter start) to lighter blue
